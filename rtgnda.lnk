4.Note

<power management>
On some systems, the state of the PCI Power Management mode is D1,
the power saving mode. I don't know who change the power state into D1.
The driver scans the power management capability and tries to change 
the state into D0, the normal operation mode. But, sometimes, 
this attempt seems to fail... 

<interrupt>
When TXCOMPINT = "NO" is specified in protocol.ini, this driver works 
in pseudo-polling mode, that is a trial method to reduce interrupts.
You can modify the polling interval by use of TXPOLLINT keyword.
If TXCOMPINT = "YES" is selected, it works as same as ver.1.04.
Pay attention, the default setting is pseudo-polling mode.

<netio>
I've received that 'NETIO' fails. Sorry, I could not correct it...

ver.1.11 - 05/11, 2006.
- RTL8168(10EC:8168) is supported.
- 2nd memory range is checked if 1st memory range is invalid.(from Pavel Shtemenko)
- I/O range check was removed.
- The default string of PCIMRW was changed into "YES".

ver.1.10 - 04/18, 2006.
- 1 new keyword, OPENBIND, was added.
- The hidden keyword, MAXFRAME, is enabled.(rtgnda.nif)
- Receive filter mode is cleared at the init time.

ver.1.09.01 - 01/16, 2006.
- D-Link DGE-528T(1186:4300) is supported.(backward to ver 1.07.01 test)

ver.1.09 - 12/17, 2005.
- 1 new keyword, IRQ15OVR, was added.

ver.1.08 - 11/15, 2005.
- Workaround for Virtual PC.

ver.1.07 - 06/17, 2005.
- Bugfix: forgetting rx queue check in polling mode.(unbelievable!)
- PCI BUS clock is checked for the polling interval timer.
- Chip specific work-around codes were added. (From solaris driver)
- Timer trigger code was modified.
- The default values of keywords(TXQUEUE, RXQUEUE, TXPOLLINT) was changed.

ver.1.06 - 12/30, 2003.
- Bus master enable and memory space enable bits in PCI command register 
   are scanned at the initial time.
- Timer control code was modified.

ver.1.05 - 11/28, 2003.
- 2 new configuration keywords, TXCOMPINT, TXPOLLINT, were added.

ver.1.02 - 6/7, 2003.
- Bugfix:1000BASE-T half-duplex advertisement is inhibited.
- Adjustment code added at ver.1.01 was removed, since it results in 
   large resident size, high CPU load.
